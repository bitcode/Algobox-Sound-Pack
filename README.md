> :warning: **Important Warning**:

> Custom alert sounds have a limitation: **they cannot play simultaneously**. If you're using the AudioBox feature within NinjaTrader8, this could mean missing critical alerts. Even using the 'continuous sound' setting may not address this issue effectively. Be aware of this constraint when selecting your custom sounds.
